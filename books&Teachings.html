      <li>In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences
        in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an
        introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of
        ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and
        information.</li>
        <br>
        <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning
          About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press,  2010.
          <ul>

          <li><em>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we
            teach entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at
            the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites.
             To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are
             supplemented with optional advanced sections.</em></li></ul>
